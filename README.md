Take a look at the demo [here](http://dfilimonov.com/github-ribbons-demo)


# How to use it?

Put *ribbons.css* in a directory where you keep your stylesheets.
Then add these lines to your page or template:

In the <head>:

  <link href="ribbons.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

In the <body>:

  <div class="ribbon left red">
    <a href="<link to your repo>">Fork me on GitHub</a>
  </div>

Enjoy!
